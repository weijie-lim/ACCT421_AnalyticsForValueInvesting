2005,"The rise of China and India as world financial powers is nothing short of amazing. Economists estimate that both nations can grow at the rate of 7-8% for decades to come. China, alone, has grown at about 9.6% for the past two decades. Together, the two countries account for one-third of the world's population.

Countries like the United States initially started outsourcing work to China and India because of cheap labor. This is no longer the case. They kept their work in the two countries because they found talent. Talent for innovation in high-tech fields. A million scientists and engineers are trained in India and China each year compared to a much lower number in the U.S. The balance of power in technologies is likely to move West to East.On August 25, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast of the U.S. as a strong Category 3 or low Category 4 storm. It quickly became the biggest natural disaster in U.S. history, almost destroying New Orleans due to severe flooding.

Hurricane Rita quickly followed Katrina only to make matters worse. Between the two, more than $200 billion in damage was done. 400,000 jobs were lost and 275,000 homes were destroyed. Many of the jobs and homes were never to be recovered. Hundreds of thousands of people were displaced and over 1,000 were killed and more are missing. The effect on oil and gasoline prices was long-lasting.

2006,"In the early part of the 21st century, the U.S. housing market was booming. Housing values were high. Just about anyone who wanted to buy a home could buy a home. A phenomenon called sub-prime lending arose. Individuals and families who, in the past, could not have qualified for a mortgage were able to qualify for adjustable-rate mortgages with low or no down payments and low initial interest rates.

Banks made mortgage loans to these individuals for houses with inflated values. As the interest rates rose and their adjustable rate loans got more expensive, they couldn't make their mortgage payments. Soon, large financial institutions were holding portfolios of loans that were worthless. The ""credit crunch"" ensued.",20.76%

2008,"In September of 2008, a seemingly perfect storm of factors came together to precipate the deepest economic downturn in not only the U.S. but across the globe, since the Great Depression. The great investment banks that had stood on Wall Street began to collapse due to the sub-prime mortgage crisis and serious corporate fraud. During the last months of the Bush Administration, the federal government stepped in to bail out some of these institutions in order to keep the U.S. financial system afloat.",6.94%
2009,"Three of the country’s most respected economists warned of a deepening economic crisis if the banking system is not quickly fixed in a wide-ranging conversation last night with Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) Chairman Daniel Yergin and an audience of nearly 1,000 people who filled the Westin Galleria ballroom at CERAWeek.

2010,"Although investors in the US and Europe awaited signs of a rebound, economic news was mixed, with some measures showing gradual improvement and others offering evidence that the economy remains vulnerable. Favorable news included moderate economic expansion in the US, Euro zone, and Australia, as well as rising factory orders and manufacturing activity, rebounding auto sales and automaker profits, slowing growth in US bankruptcies, declining home foreclosures, and an improving financial services sector. In late Q3, US corporate cash levels reached $1.9 trillion, which, as a percentage of total corporate assets, is the highest since 1959. In late Q4, initial claims for unemployment fell to the lowest level in two years.
Negative news included continuing high jobless rates in the US and other developed markets. US unemployment began the year at 9.7%, dipped to 9.5% in July, but climbed to 9.8% in November. Personal bankruptcies in the US increased 9%, reaching their highest level since 2005. Also, bank failures in 2010 were the worst since 1992, during the savings and loan crisis.

Housing and Real Estate
The global property decline that helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis began to ease in 2010. Home prices improved in the UK but remained weak in the US, with monthly sales of new homes falling at one point to the lowest level since tracking was initiated in 1963. Foreclosures increased dramatically in the first half of 2010 before improving in Q4. However, 2010 proved to be another successful year for REITs, despite recurring predictions of a brewing commercial real estate collapse that would trigger a financial crisis.

Quantitative Easing and Fiscal Stimulus
Governments and central banks took additional actions to stimulate economies and shore up financial markets. The most direct support came as central banks supported government bond markets in the US and Europe. The Federal Reserve’s November announcement of a second round of quantitative easing (known as “QE2”) sparked concern that additional monetary stimulus would stoke inflation and debase the dollar. According to some, the actions helped lift stocks and corporate bond markets. In December, the extension of the Bush-era tax cuts and a 2% reduction in Social Security payroll taxes in 2011 improved economic expectations.

Sovereign Debt Worries
During the year, the weakening finances of some European states, including Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Belgium, raised concern that the financial crisis had moved from private-sector banks to public-sector balance sheets. These concerns led to the downgrading of certain government debt and widening of bond yield spreads. The Euro zone countries and International Monetary Fund responded with loans that were conditional on some sovereign borrowers taking drastic austerity measures.

Inflation vs. Deflation
Despite moderate inflation in most economies during 2010, economists warned that continued government budget deficits and monetary expansion would drive up prices. Conversely, the US central bank was concerned that inflation was so low that the economy might slip into a deflationary cycle. In fact, potential deflation was one of the main reasons the Fed implemented QE2 and pumped $600 billion into the banking system. By year end, the Fed indicated that the deflation threat was easing.

Higher Commodity Prices
Commodities climbed during 2010, with many sectors reaching price levels not seen in decades. Copper prices, which are considered a bellwether of economic activity, rose 33%, and oil gained 15% to finish 2010 over $91 a barrel. Agricultural commodities, a traditionally volatile sector, saw even more extreme price swings. Concern about a weakening dollar drove up precious metals, with gold exceeding $1,400 per ounce and silver up 81% for the year.

Investor Confidence
In the wake of the financial crisis, investors who have become more risk averse or accepted the tenets of a “new normal” in the economy and markets chose to remain in fixed income assets. Bond funds in the US received a massive net inflow of money in the past two years, suggesting that many investors who fled stocks may have missed out on much of the rebound in equities. Throughout most of 2010, investment flows were leaving the US stock market and moving to emerging markets. In December, flows turned sharply positive in the US, with an estimated $22 billion directed to US stock funds.",38%
2011,"On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and 100-foot high tsunami pummeled Japan's northeastern shoreline. At least 28,000 people died or went missing. Over 465,000 were displaced. To make things worse, the waves damaged the Fukushima nuclear power plant, creating radioactive leaks.The ""Triple Disaster"" devastated Japan's economy. It devastated the country's nuclear industry and convinced Europe to cut back its reliance on nuclear power. When Japan's suppliers shut down, it slowed a global economy still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis.",-11.59%
2012,"When Facebook went public in May, investors went nuts getting their hands on shares of the hottest tech IPO in history.

Unfortunately, Facebook stock value quickly plummeted from an IPO price of $38.23 down to the mid-twenties, even dropping to under $18 at one point, causing thousands of hasty investors to lose huge chucks of change.

Falling share prices wasn’t the only problem to emerge from the Facebook IPO, either. A NASDAQ trading glitch within the first few hours of the IPO caused incorrect trades to be placed, resulting in major losses for some big investors.

Morgan Stanley (the underwriter for these faulty trades), along with the NASDAQ, are currently facing lawsuits as a result.",51.38%
2013,"U.S. stocks made headlines by going on a tear - rising 32% during the year. The stock market rises by over 30% about once or twice in a decade, and last year was one such time that it did. It also happened to be the best return in 16 years.

To put the number further into context, if you purchased a 10 year Canadian government bond that yields 2.8% per year today, it would take 10 years for your money to compound into 32%. Of course, lest we get carried away, we should also remember that stocks have lost some 37% just 5 years ago. While stocks have the potential to rise fast, it has the potential to fall fast as well, and 2013 just happened to be a year when it rose fast.Natural gas rose almost 32% last year, so you would think this is great news for natural gas producers. Although this certainly is good news, natural gas prices were at historical lows last year, so even after a big gain last year, natural gas prices are still low comparative to previous years. Having been an oil and gas analyst in the past, I feel I have some insight into this industry, and I think the prices are still too low for many producers to make much money.

On the other end of the spectrum, gold has had a terrible year. This fact has been especially painful for those people (and there were many) who invested almost exclusively in gold and gold mining companies after having subscribed to the Austrian school of economics. These people believed that the Federal Reserve's money printing will lead to hyperinflation, and cause gold prices to shoot higher.

As the years progressed, it became more and more apparent that the advisors who predicted hyperinflation were simply wrong (see this article for an explanation on why we didn't get high inflation), and last year, the investors began to capitulate and sell their golden holdings. The selloff affected not just gold prices, but the many gold mining companies listed in the TSX as well, and this has partly led to the Canadian stocks' underperformance relative to U.S. stocks.

Bonds Had A Forgettable Year
While stocks enjoyed a good year, the same couldn't be said of bonds.

I'm on record for predicting poor results for XBB.TO (a medium to long term bond ETF), so let me give you an update. If you had invested in XBB.TO for the whole of last year, you would have lost 1.6% of your money, even after you account for interest payments. On the other hand, if you had invested in XSB.TO (a short term bond ETF) instead, you would have gained 1.4%.

However, I must say that it's too early to tell if I'm really right to recommend XSB.TO instead of XBB.TO. Things can change quickly in the financial markets, and a sudden downward movement in long term interest rates can vindicate people for choosing XBB.TO. 

Bonds offer you protection for your money, whereas stocks and other higher risk investments do not, so I highly recommend having some portion of your money in bonds. However, if I were you, I'd still go with short term bonds over medium-to-long term bonds - for now.

That's how the financial markets did in a nutshell. A couple of days from now, I'll write my thoughts on how MoneyGeek's portfolios did overall last year.",62.01%
2014,"The Affordable Care Act expanded health coverage to 20 million people. They could receive low-cost preventive care for chronic illnesses. That kept them out of expensive emergency rooms. As a result, the rise in health care costs slowed. That may have helped the United States receive a better score from the World Health Organization.

China is also the largest holder of U.S. debt. It owns $1.2 billion of U.S. Treasuries. This gives it leverage. For example, in August 2007, China threatened to sell part its holdings if Congressional pressure to raise the value of the yuan continued.",8.99%
